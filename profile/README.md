## 🔍 What Is Fortnite Wallhack?

A wallhack, or ESP (Extra Sensory Perception), overlays in-game data directly onto your screen. It gives you the power to:

* **Track player positions in real-time**
* **See opponents through walls, builds, and terrain**
* **Spot loot, chests, ammo, traps & NPCs**
* **Know exactly when and where enemies are aiming**
* **React before the fight even begins**

And the best part? You never have to guess again. Peek with confidence and play 10 steps ahead every time.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

You don’t need a beast setup to be wall-busting:

* **OS:** Windows 10/11 64-bit
* **CPU:** Intel i3 / Ryzen 3 or higher
* **RAM:** 6GB+

---

## ⚙️ Installation Guide

1. Launch Fortnite normally, load into the main lobby
2. Run your injector (Xenos, Kernel, etc.) as admin
3. Inject the ESP DLL into `FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping.exe`
4. Press `Insert` to toggle the in-game ESP menu
5. Adjust what’s visible: enemies, boxes, loot, names, etc.
6. Jump in-game and become the **all-seeing bean**

Bonus: Some builds offer *auto-configs* that activate only in combat zones.

## 🧠 Pro Tips for Staying Undetected

* ✅ Use only **ESP** (no aimbot = less reports)
* ✅ Keep your FOV narrow & no skeletons if you want to look clean
* ✅ Don’t pre-aim or track enemies too obviously
* ✅ Use alt accounts or test on a smurf before going hard
* ✅ Combine with VPN + cleaner for added safety

## 🔥 Real Player Feedback

> “I wiped trios before they even peeked me. This wallhack is scary good 👀” – @SilentBox
>

## 🚫 Warning – Ban Risk?

Yup. Even ESP-only hacks carry a risk—especially if you overplay it or get mass reported.

**This tool is currently undetected**, but:

* Use it smartly
* Play casual if you’re on your main
* Go full throttle on alts only

Epic Games has detection triggers, but subtle ESP use flies under the radar way more than fly hacks or aimlocks.

Fortnite Wallhack is the **perfect blend of OP and stealth**. You’ll have intel on every squad, every push, every chest, and every angle—**before it happens**. Whether you’re going for crown wins, sweaty endgames, or just farming clips, this ESP tool turns you into a tactical machine.

**No more guesswork. Just laser focus, every time.**
